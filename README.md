In this assignment, we implement SVM algorithm to classify the given datasets, i.e., breast cancer dataset and iris dataset.
***
#### How to run code
Simply running the code is fine. It will first train the model for breast cancer dataset and test it afterward. Then, it repeat again for iris data set. Both above training is based on slack variable $C = 1.0$. At last, we adjust the calue of slack variable to see how the accuracy will change accordingly.
