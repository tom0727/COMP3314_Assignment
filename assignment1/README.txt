In this assignment, we implement SVM algorithm to classify the given datasets, i.e., breast cancer dataset and iris dataset.
***
#### How to run code <br>

Method1: Through Terminal <br>
Under the directory ```assignment1/``` , run the following command in the terminal:
``` python3 SVM.py ```

Method2: Through IDE <br>
Open an IDE and import project if necessary, if you are using Pycharm, open SVM.py and just run the code is sufficient.

It will first train the model for breast cancer dataset and test it with different values of C afterwards. Then, it repeats again for iris data set.  
We adjust the calue of slack variable to see how the accuracy will change accordingly. A visual of accuracy of two datasets agianst values of C is plotted.  
The results and analysis are written in the report.
